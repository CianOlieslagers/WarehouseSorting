Stack S:
- Capacity (cs)
- Positions
- StackID

Boxes:
- BoxID

Vehicles V:
- Capacity (cv)  OK
- (Un)loading speed/time (loading time = unloading time)
- Vehicle speed
- 

Set of transfer requests R:
- Tuple <srpu, srpl, br>
- srpu = Pickup location (buffer point or storage stack)
- srpl = Place location/delivery location (buffer point or storage stack)
- br = associated box
- every request is associated with a Vehicle
- has an ID

Map maken (plattegrond):
- Location entrance and exit
- Location stacks
- Initial positions vehicles
- 

Constraints:
- Multiple vehicles can't (un)load at the same stack (you can at buffer point)
- 

How it goes:
- V travels from current location (sv) to srpu
- Load b from top of associated stack
- Travel from srpu to srpl
- Unload b atop srpl

Special cases:
- If box not at top of stack -> relocate the boxes on top of the target box. Relocate to any free stack
- 

Extra:
- Employ multiple vehicles
-
